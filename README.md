# GT CSE 6250 Spring Project

Our team will attempt to validate the results of [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313698)
and show that a CNN deep learning model can better categorize social media posts 
according to risk for suicide comparted to traditional ML models.

### Google Collab
The [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fVu84WMKqF3Fa7VqJ3zFT6rt5D_TMR9e?usp=sharing) show a partial implementation of our replication using a limited dataset.

### Full Source Code Instructions
The full source code includes procedures for re-building a dataset, running and optimizing the models.

(Note that python 3.11 was used to build this project.)

1. Create python environment and install required modules (ie. pip install -r requirements.txt). 
2. Open and run all cells in the file [CSE-6250-Team-A1-Full Source Code.ipynb](https://github.com/bpopp/CSE-6250-Final-Project/blob/main/CSE-6250-Team-A1-Full%20Source%20Code.ipynb)
